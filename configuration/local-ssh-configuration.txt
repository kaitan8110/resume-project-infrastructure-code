# ProxyCommand: This is a seamless way to SSH into your private instances via the bastion host. You need to configure your local SSH client to use the bastion host as a proxy for the connection to your jenkins-vm.

# Sample
Host bastion
    HostName <bastion_host_public_ip>
    User ec2-user
    IdentityFile /path/to/your/bastion-key.pem

Host jenkins-vm
    HostName <jenkins_vm_private_ip>
    User ec2-user
    IdentityFile /path/to/your/jenkins-vm-key.pem
    ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p bastion

# Example
Host bastion
    HostName 18.143.246.178
    User ec2-user
    IdentityFile /Users/kaiwork/Desktop/github/resume-project/secrets/resume-project-key-pair.pem

Host jenkins-vm
    HostName 10.0.2.234
    User ec2-user
    IdentityFile /Users/kaiwork/Desktop/github/resume-project/secrets/resume-project-key-pair.pem
    ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p bastion
